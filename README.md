# SSH/Linux/Bash/Vim Workshop

## Windows
Install [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
it's an SSH client that will allow us to access the linux machine we will be using.

The key file is in this repository. For windows it's the .ppk file

connect to `13.236.178.105` with user `workshop` to join in on the fun!

## Linux / Mac
If you are already on Linux WHY ARE YOU HERE?!?!

For Mac users, you apparently should already have an SSH client installed. So
that's all well and good.

Just download the workshop file (no extension) from the repository and run:

```bash
ssh -i workshop workshop@13.236.178.105
```

From a command line to join in on the fun!
